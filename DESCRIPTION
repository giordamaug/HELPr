Description: Essential genes are commonly defined as those required for the 
growth and survival of any organism or cell. 
HELP stands for “Human Gene Essentiality Labelling & Prediction”, 
a computational framework for labelling and predicting essential genes, 
and HELPr is a R implementation of the HELP framework. 
Its double scope allows achieving the identification of genes through the 
dependency or not from experimental data. HELPr is a library of tools 
useful for the identification of domain-specific context genes that can 
highlight multiple levels of essentiality, and thus significance in the 
functional role of genes.
